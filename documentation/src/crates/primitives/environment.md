# Environment

A significant module that manages the execution environment of the EVM. The module contains objects and methods associated with processing transactions and blocks within such a blockchain environment. It defines several structures: `Env`, `BlockEnv`, `TxEnv`, `CfgEnv`, and `CreateScheme`. These structures contain various fields representing the block data, transaction data, environmental configurations, transaction recipient details, and the method of contract creation respectively.

The `Env` structure, which encapsulates the environment of the EVM, contains methods for calculating effective gas prices and for validating block and transaction data. It also checks transactions against the current state of the associated account, which is necessary to validate the transaction's nonce and the account balance. Various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are also considered in these validations, such as [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) for the base fee, [EIP-3607](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3607) for rejecting transactions from senders with deployed code, and [EIP-3298](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3298) for disabling gas refunds. The code is structured to include optional features and to allow for changes in the EVM specifications.
