# Log

> Note: This module's types have been replaced by [`alloy_primitives`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/core)'s `Log` and `LogData`.

This piece of Rust code defines a structure called Log which represents an Ethereum log entry. These logs are integral parts of the Ethereum network and are typically produced by smart contracts during execution. Each Log has three components:

- `address`: This field represents the address of the log originator, typically the smart contract that generated the log. The `Address` data type signifies a 160-bit Ethereum address.

- `topics`: This field is a vector of `B256` type. In Ethereum, logs can have multiple '`topics`'. These are events that can be used to categorize and filter logs. The `B256` type denotes a 256-bit hash, which corresponds to the size of a topic in Ethereum.

- `data`: This is the actual data of the log entry. The Bytes type is a dynamically-sized byte array, and it can contain any arbitrary data. It contains additional information associated with the event logged by a smart contract.
