## Running eth tests

Eth tests are a suite of tests from the Ethereum Foundation that are used to test EVM implementations.
Part of these tests are included in the revm repository in the `tests` folder.

Test suites for the latest hardforks can be found in EEST releases https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases, and there are additional tests that cover older hardforks in https://github.com/ethereum/legacytests

Revm can run statetest type of tests with `revme` using the following command:
`cargo run --release -p revme -- statetest folder_path`

For running EEST tests, we can use  the `./scripts/run-tests.sh.`

For legacy tests, we need to first to download the repo `git clone https://github.com/ethereum/legacytests` and run then run it with `cargo run --release -p revme -- statetest legacytests/Cancun/GeneralStateTests `
All statetest that can be run by revme can be found in the `GeneralStateTests` folder.
