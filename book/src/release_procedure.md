# Release procedure

This document describes the procedure for releasing a new version of the `revm` project. The repository is hosted on github and published to crates.io. Every published crate is part of one tag (currently tag v55) that contains all crates versions. The versions depending on the change can be major, minor, or patch; we don't have one version for all packages.

Link of tag to the particular version of the crate can be found in CHANGELOG file.
