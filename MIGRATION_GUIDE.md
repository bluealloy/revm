# v70 tag (revm v22.0.2) -> v71 tag ( revm v23.0.0)

* Removal of `EvmData`.
    * It got flattened and ctx/inspector fields moved directly to Evm, additional layering didn't have purpose.
* Merging of `Handler`'s `validate_tx_against_state` and `deduct_caller` into one function `validate_against_state_and_deduct_caller`
    * If you dont override those functions there is no action. If you do please look at `pre_execution::validate_against_state_and_deduct_caller`
    function or `OpHandler` for examples of migration.
* Breaking changed for EOF to support eof-devnet1. 
* `SharedMemory` is not longer Rc<RefCell<>> and internally uses Rc<RefCell<Vec<u8>>> buffer.
    * No action if you dont use it inside Interpreter.
* In `JournalExt` fn `last_journal()` is renamed to `journal()`
