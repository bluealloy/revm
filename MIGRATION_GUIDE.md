No breaking changes

# v91 tag ( revm v30.1.1)

No breaking changes

# v90 tag ( revm v30.1.0)

* Removal of some deprecated functions. `into_plain_state`, `regenerate_hash` were deprecated few releases ago.

# v89 tag ( op-revm)

No breaking changes

# v88 tag (revm v30.0.0)

* `ContextTr`, `EvmTr` gained `all_mut()` and `all()` functions.
  * `InspectorEvmTr` got `all_inspector` and `all_mut_inspector` functions.
  * For custom Evm, you only need to implement `all_*` functions.
* `InspectorFrame` got changed to allow CustomFrame to be added.
  * If there is no need for inspection `fn eth_frame` can return None.
* `kzg-rs` feature and library removed. Default KZG implementation is now c-kzg.
  * for no-std variant, arkworks lib is used.
* Opcodes that load account/storage will not load item if there is not enough gas for cold load.
  * This is in preparation for BAL.
  * Journal functions for loading now have skip_cold_load bool.
* `libsecp256k1` parity library is deprecated and removed.
* `JumpTable` internal representation changed from `BitVec` to `Bytes`. No changes in API.
* `SpecId` enum gained new `Amsterdam` variant and `OpSpecId` gained `Jovian` variant.
* `SELFDESTRUCT` constant renamed to `SELFDESTRUCT_REFUND`.
* `FrameStack::push` and `FrameStack::end_init` marked as `unsafe` as it can cause UB.
* First precompile error is now bubble up with detailed error messages. New `PrecompileError` variants added.
* Batch execution errors now include transaction index.
* `CallInput` now contains bytecode that is going to be executed (Previously it had address).
  * This allows skipping double bytecode fetching.
* `InvalidTransaction` enum gained `Str(Cow<'static, str>)` variant for custom error messages.
* `calc_excess_blob_gas` and `calc_excess_blob_gas` removes as they are unused and not accurate for Prague.

# v86 tag (revm v29.0.0)

* `PrecompileWithAddress` is renamed to `Precompile` and it became a struct.
  * `Precompile` contains`PrecompileId`, `Address` and function.
  * The reason is adding `PrecompileId` as it is needed for fusaka hardfork

# v85 tag (revm v28.0.1) from v84 tag (revm v28.0.0)

Forward compatible version.

# v84 tag (revm v28.0.0) from v83 tag (revm v27.1.0)

* `SystemCallEvm` functions got renamed and old ones are deprecated. Renaming is done to align it with other API calls.
   * `transact_system_call_finalize` is now `system_call`.
   * `transact_system_call` is now `system_call_one`.
* `ExtBytecode::regenerate_hash` got deprecated in support for `get_or_calculate_hash` or `calculate_hash`.
* Precompiles:
  * Bn128 renamed to Bn254. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10029#issue-3240867404
* `InstructionResult` now starts from 1 (previous 0) for perf purposes.
* In `JournalInner` previous `precompiles`, `warm_coinbase_address` and `warm_preloaded_addresses` pub fields are now moved to `warm_addresses` to encapsulate addresses that are warm by default. All access list account are all loaded from database.


# v83 tag (revm v27.1.0) from v82 tag (revm v27.0.3)

* `ContextTr` gained `Host` supertrait.
  * Previously Host was implemented for any T that has ContextTr, this restricts specializations.
  https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/issues/2732
  * `Host` is moved to `revm-context-interface`
  * If you custom struct that implement `ContextTr` you would need to manually implement `Host` trait, in most cases no action needed.
* In `revm-interpreter`, fn `cast_slice_to_u256` was removed and `push_slice` fn is added to `StackTrait`.
* `PrecompileOutput` now contains revert flag.
  * It is safe to put to false.
* In `kzg` and `blake2` modules few internal functions were made private or removed.

# v80 tag (revm v27.0.0) -> v81 tag ( revm v27.0.1)

* Inspector fn `step_end` is now called even if Inspector `step` sets the action. Previously this was not the  case.
    * https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/pull/2687
    * this additionally fixes panic bug where `bytecode.opcode()` would panic in `step_end`

# v70 tag (revm v22.0.2) -> v71 tag ( revm v23.0.0)

* Removal of `EvmData`.
    * It got flattened and ctx/inspector fields moved directly to Evm, additional layering didn't have purpose.
* Merging of `Handler`'s `validate_tx_against_state` and `deduct_caller` into one function `validate_against_state_and_deduct_caller`
    * If you dont override those functions there is no action. If you do please look at `pre_execution::validate_against_state_and_deduct_caller`
    function or `OpHandler` for examples of migration.
* Breaking changed for EOF to support eof-devnet1. 
* `SharedMemory` is not longer Rc<RefCell<>> and internally uses Rc<RefCell<Vec<u8>>> buffer.
    * No action if you dont use it inside Interpreter.
* In `JournalExt` fn `last_journal_mut()` is renamed to `journal_mut()`
* EOF is disabled from Osaka and not accessible.

# v68 tag (revm v21.0.0) -> v70 tag ( revm v22.0.2)

No breaking changes

# v67 tag (revm v21.0.0) -> v68 tag ( revm v22.0.0)
