Main changes can be summarizes in:
* f91d5f9 - refactor: remove gas blocks (#391) (5 weeks ago) <Bjerg>

# v3.0.0
date 29.01.2022

This is big release that has core changes that breaks compatibility. In summary:
*  Project is refactored into `revm-primitives`,`revm-precompile`,`revm-interpreter` and `revm` to have more flexibility and separation of concerns. And include paths in revm reflect that. So try to find include as `revm::primitives` or `revm::interpreter`
* Parity `primitive-types` was replaced with `ruint` for big numbers and subset of macros are used for native `B160`/`B256` types. 
* Interpreter instructions are unified and now all of them have same signature.
* web3 db was replaces with ethers alternative.
* revmjs lib was removed from crates.
* `revm_precompiles` was renamed to `revm-precompile.`

* Return types are made to have more insight of what have happened inside revm.
* Snailtracer benchmark got around 20% faster.

Consensus bugs:
* SELFDESTRUCT was not handled correctly. It would remove account/storage but it should just mark it for removal. This bug was here from earlier version of revm. (#175)
* fix: set gas_block to empty bytecode (#172). Introduced in v1.8.0 with bytecode format.

# v1.9.0
date: 09.08.2022

Small release. Optimizations

* bump dependencies and few standard derives.

# v1.5.0
date: 09.06.2022

Consensus error related to gas block optimization and `sstore` min stipend. Solution is to make `sstore` instruction as `gas_block_end` as to not spend future instruction gas when checking min stipend condition introduced in EIP-2200.

* Consensus error with gas block for SSTORE stipend check (#124)

Changes:
* Bug fix for unknown OpCode
* Omit edgecase high nonce test. tracer gas fix 
* Some internal cleanup

# v1.0.0
date: 18.12.2021

It feel's like that the lib is in the state that is okay to promote it to the v1 version. Other that that, a lot of optimizations are done and the inspector trait was rewritten.

Changes:

### 17.10.2021:
-For past few weeks working on this structure and project in general become really good and I like it. For me it surved as good distraction for past few weeks and i think i am going to get drained if i continue working on it, so i am taking break and i intend to come back after few months and finish it.
- For status:
    * machine/spec/opcodes/precompiles(without modexp) feels good and I probably dont need to touch them.
    * inspector: is what i wanted, full control on insides of EVM so that we can control it and modify it. will probably needs to add some small tweaks to interface but nothing major.
    * subroutines: Feels okay but it needs more scrutiny just to be sure that all corner cases are covered.
    * Test that are failing (~20) are mostly related to EIP-158: State clearing. For EIP-158 I will time to do it properly.
    * There is probably benefit of replaing HashMap hasher with something simpler, but this is research for another time.
