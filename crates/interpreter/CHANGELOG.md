date 02.10.2023

Migration to alloy primitive types.

* af4146a - feat: Alloy primitives (#724) (15 hours ago) <evalir>
* 1f86e45 - chore(deps): bump proptest from 1.2.0 to 1.3.1 (#763) (22 hours ago) <dependabot[bot]>

# v1.2.0
date: 28.09.2023

Summary:
* Cancun support:
  * EIP-7516: BLOBBASEFEE opcode
  * EIP-4844: Shard Blob Transactions
  * EIP-1153: Transient storage opcodes
  * EIP-5656: MCOPY - Memory copying instruction
* Rename `SHA3` to `KECCAK256`, this can potentially break some tracers.
* Refactor opcodes and Interpreter dispatch loop. Better performance.
* optimize stack usage for recursive `call` and `create` programs.
    This brings down the native stack usage as calls are in recursion.
